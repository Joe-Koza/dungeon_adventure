    <h1>A Dragon!</h1>
    <body>
        <p>You open the doors, and see a dragon resting on an enormous pile of gold coins and gems. It doesn't look like the most comfortable 
        place to sleep, but it doesn't seem to mind. Once you enter the room, the doors slam shut behind you and wake up the dragon. It roars
        and stands up, ready to fight!</p>
