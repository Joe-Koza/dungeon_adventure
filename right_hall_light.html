            After taking a torch, you go to the right hallway. You are able to see more clearly, and spot a tripwire. 
            You carefully step over it to avoid activating any traps and continuing on your way, feeling very clever.
        </p>
        <p>You reach the end of the hall, and stand in front of huge double doors.</p>
