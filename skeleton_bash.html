        <p>Using the mordhau technique, the blunt impact of your sword's guard and pommel makes short work of the skeletons.
            Your gauntlets protect your hands from the blade's edge, and strikes from the skeletons' rusted weapons glance harmlessly
            off of your armor. You manage to end the fight quickly and unscathed. 
        </p>
        <p>Among the bones you find a key! It may be useful later. Other than that, there doesn't seem to be anything in this room.</p>
