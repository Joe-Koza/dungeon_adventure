            Yor blade is deadly, but unfortunately not the most efficient at dealing with skeletons. They have no flesh to cut, organs
            to pierce, or blood to spill, so fighting them is an uphill battle. Maybe this is why so many clerics use maces...

            Your armor is effective, but even their rusted weapons manage to find the weak spots in your joints and neck. Eventually you fall,
            and join the undead warriors, awaiting the next foolish victim that comes along.
